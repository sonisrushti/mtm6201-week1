    <p class="myself">Hi, my name is Srushti and I hail from India. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer
        Applications from Charusat University in India. My interests include sketching, drawing, cooking, and gaming.
        I'm particularly fond of playing online games, with Valorant being a personal favorite. Additionally, traveling
        is another passion of mine. Ever since I was a child, I've had a strong interest in painting and sketching. One
        day, I discovered the possibility of creating artwork on a screen using software - this blew my mind! From that
        day on, I began exploring the basics of design, which came naturally to me. I ultimately decided to pursue a
        career in graphic design and am eager to put my skills to use upon completion of this program. Before starting
        my own venture, I believe it's important to gain hands-on experience by working with companies to learn more
        about the industry and develop my skills.
